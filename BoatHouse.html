<p>The restaurant gives you a really great view of the river and you can catch a beautiful sunset at the right time of day. Plenty of free parking as well.Our waitress, Angie, was great. Personable, attentive and quick-witted. Such a pleasure. We had the salmon with garlic mashed and spinach, the Lucy burger stuffed with cheese curds, the 14 oz. ribeye and the 28 oz. bone in ribeye. Also the French onion soup was excellent and the southwest chicken dumpling soup had a great base and the dumplings were great. The salmon was great but the potatoes and spinach were a little salty. The burger was real flavorful with the garlic aioli and bourbon onions made it over the top and messy. The two steaks were done to liking with the caramelized onions on top. We would definitely come back.</p>
